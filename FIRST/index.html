                        <b>Gracious Professionalism&reg;:</b>Gracious Professionalism 
                        is part of the ethos of FIRST. It's a way of doing things 
                        that encourages high-quality work, emphasizes the value of 
                        others, and respects individuals and the community.

                        With Gracious Professionalism, fierce competition and 
                        mutual gain are not separate notions. Gracious 
                        professionals learn and compete like crazy, but treat one 
                        another with respect and kindness in the process. They avoid 
                        treating anyone like losers. No chest thumping tough talk, but 
                        no sticky-sweet platitudes either. Knowledge, competition, and 
                        empathy are comfortably blended.

                        In the long run, Gracious Professionalism is part of 
                        pursuing a meaningful life. One can add to society and 
                        enjoy the satisfaction of knowing one has acted with 
                        integrity and sensitivity.

                        At FIRST, Coopertition is displaying unqualified kindness 
                        and respect in the face of fierce competition. Coopertition 
                        is founded on the concept and a philosophy that teams can 
                        and should help and cooperate with each other even as they 
                        compete.

                        Coopertition involves learning from teammates. It is 
                        teaching teammates. It is learning from Mentors. And it 
                        is managing and being managed. Coopertition means 
                        competing always, but assisting and enabling others when 
                        you can.

                        Competition the ultimate Sport for the Mind. 
                        High-school student participants call it “the hardest 
                        fun you’ll ever have.”

                        Under strict rules, limited time and resources, teams 
                        of students are challenged to raise funds, design a 
                        team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and 
                        program industrial-size robots to play a difficult 
                        field game against like-minded competitors. It’s as 
                        close to real-world engineering as a student can get. 
                        Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and 
                        talents to guide each team. Each season ends with an 
                        exciting FIRST Championship.
