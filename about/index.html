                            We are Team #6834, a robotics team made up of over 25 Watkins Memorial HS students with various backgrounds
                            and diverse STEM skills. We are trying to raise money and find mentors in order to build a successful
                            robot and compete in the 2020 FRC competition (FRC) through FIRST. FIRST is an international organization
                            whose mission is "to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in 
                            exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills, that inspire 
                            innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and
                            leadership."

                                technical skills, build a robot to complete the objectives created by FIRST, and compete with other high 
                                school teams at a regional FRC competition. Teams along with coaches and mentors work during a six-week build
                                season starting in January to solve the engineering design problem and build and program a game-playing robot 
                                that weighs up to 125 pounds. They work with other teams to form alliance to play the game at events where they 
                                are judged on design, innovation , culture-changing behavior, and performance. The program is a life-changing, 
                                career-molding experience and it's a lot of fun.

                                The Robotics team meets during the entire school year. Team members work collaboratively to gain hands-on technical
                                skills such as engineering design (CAD); trade-specific skills in mechanical, electrical, gearing, manipulators, 
                                drive and pneumatics systems; and programming.  Along the way,  they gain experience in problem solving, critical
                                thinking, leadership, and project/ business management skills. The culminating event is a regional FIRST Robotics
                                Competition. The robot will have to complete tasks such as throwing balls into goals, flying discs into goals, place 
                                inner tubes onto racks, hanging on bars, and balancing robots on balance beams. The game for the competition, along
                                with the required set of tasks, changes annually and is announced in January which begins the official build season.

               <h2>August-December</h2>
               Throughout August, all the way to the end of December and up to the start of kickoff, the technicians
               are responsible for training new members on how to operate the machinery, how to build a stable
               and efficient robot, and how to use the drivetrain in order to move the robot around the competition field.
               <h2>January 4th-Febuary 27th</h2>
               Once the season kickoff has been launched and we know the type of challenges that the robot will have to
               complete. The technicians then get to work on coming up with ideas that they can build to help the robot
               complete these obsticles. One year the robot may have to insert a ball into a rocket or it may need to
               attach an object somewhere else on the field. The technicians will be building, attaching, and possibly
               fixing any/all of these up until the team's competition date.

                    The Programmers work with different types of code to help make the robot and controllers function properly.
                    This allows for a wide array of challenging hurdles, facing many issues repetitively.

               <h2>August-December</h2>
               In the programming department from August all the way to the kickoff day they are teaching the new
               members that are interested in helping code the robot, how to code using Java. They also learn about
               different parts of the robot and how they should run so then they have a better understanding of what
               they are actually programming the robot for.
               <h2>January 4th-Febuary 27th</h2>
               Kickoff happens on January 4th and once the buidlers know what they'll be building and what their attachment
               is going to do they let the programmers know how they would like it to function. So then all of them get to
               work on programming all the different motors, attachments, wheels, and more. Up until close to the tournament
               these people will continue to test and make sure older code they may have created is still working and up to date.

               <h2>August-December</h2>
               In business from the start of the team all the way to kickoff these people are reaching out to different companies
               and asking them if they would like to sponsor us so then we can start getting funding to help pay for robot parts/equipment,
               tournament entrance fees, new computers for us to use to code, and more. They also design different event flyers like for the
               kickoff and parent meeting they'll design a flyer for the parents, flyers will go up around the school that tell students who
               we are, what we do and how they can join.
               <h2>January 4th-Febuary 27th</h2>
               Even after the kickoff to the season they are still writing grants and continue to make sure we have all the funding we need
               to be able to compete. They are also dealing with the public and getting our name and what we do out into our community so people
               know who we are and what we do.
